final project for CSI4341 at Baylor University
simulate a solar system, written in C++ and openGL.


General idea:
Solar system with accurate planet radius, orbit, orbit duration, inclination, moon, rings of Saturn, astroid belt and randomly generated meteors.
Texture applied.
Zoom in and zoom out allows you to feel inside of the space and get closed to any planet.

Highlight: 
realistic skybox
particle added on sun
Able to play around with the astroid by clicking them(this can only be done without any rotation applied).
