Final project for CSI4341 at Baylor University
Simulation of a solar system, written in C++ and openGL.
To run the project, you have to install glui and freeglut to you environment.
I provided a awesome guide from my professor.

General idea:
Solar system with accurate planet radius, orbit, orbit duration, inclination, moon, rings of Saturn, astroid belt and randomly generated meteors.
Texture applied.
Zoom in and zoom out allows you to feel inside of the space and get closed to any planet.

Highlight: 
realistic skybox
particle added on sun
Able to play around with the astroid by clicking them(this can only be done without any rotation applied).
